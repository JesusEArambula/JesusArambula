      <p>
        I was born in Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico, raised in a small neighborhood as a single child.
        After my 7th birthday my parents decided to move to San Diego with our new visa cards.
        I went to elementary school in Paradise Hills Elementary School where I attended 2nd and 3rd grade.
        My parents, once again wanted to move to another location, to Chula Vista in Sand Diego.
        I attended Rosebank Elementary School where I finished the rest of my grades.
        Shortly after, we moved back to Mexico. I attended middle school in various locations, 
        including Tijuana, Rosarito, Ensenada, and San Quintin.
        Before even finishing middle school, my parents wanted to take one more trip to the United States, 
        this time to San Francisco, where I attended and graduated from Raoul Wallenberg High School. 
        I am currently attending City College of San Francisco majoring in Computer Science 
        and planning to transfer to San Francisco State University.

          As an intensive program as it may be, Dev/Mission has been motivating me to achieve more in my computer science career.
          This program has been teaching me all I need to become successful in the tech industry, not just for computer science
          but in all aspects of the IT technician job. We learn everything about the hardware components that make up our everyday devices
          as well as learning how to code, including creating this website! Me and the rest of the cohort were led by a group of smart 
          and talented <a href="https://devmission.org/about-us/" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">individuals from Dev/Mission</a> 
          teaching us all the things we need to know regarding tech. I wanted to take this opportunity to join Dev/Mission and improve not just my programming 
          but also my communications skills, as interpersonal skills are one of the most important skills to have if you want to strive in the tech industry.

          Though they may not be the cheapest guitars they are definitely high quality. Their guitars are made from cmoposite materials such as carbon fiber 
          and ekoa. Because of the long process and small staff in the workshop, these guitars go for a few thousands dollars. I had the opportunity 
          to work with Blackbird Guitars through an internship at 
          <a href="https://enterpriseforyouth.org/" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Enterprise for Youth</a>. In Blackbird Guitars 
          I learned how to use many medium heavy tools like the sanding belt and buffing table in addition to other heavy machinery 
          and learn how their guitars were made. My main job in the guitar shop was to create guitar pieces, like bridges, nuts, and necks,
          using a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine. In it I would place a plate of carbon fiber where the CNC machine would cute it into the shape of the bridges
          and other guitar components. I would then continue to sand, buff, and place it in the appropriate container for the rest of the staff to use it in guitar builds.
          At the end of the internship, the manager offered me a position to work at Blackbird Guitars. But because it was the summer before I started College
          I didn't want the stress, so I had to decline. Overall, I had a great experience at Blackbird Guitars and would definitely go back with them anytime!

          YouthLINE is part of an organization called CHALK, where I learned about Dev/Mission in the first place.
          In YouthLINE I focus on typing articles regarding current events and discuss about it with the other staff in YouthLINE.
          We post these articles in our website YouthLINE SF. We also publish these articles on magazines every month. 
          We also conduct pods casts and tv shows weekly and discuss various topics that can help youth in our everyday society.
          My experience at YouthLINE increased my literaccy skills as well as improving my typing speed. I still continue 
          writing articles wtih YouthLINE and hope to keep working with them for as long as I can.

          I've been playing music since I was in middle school in Mexico. Started with piano, then guitar, 
          and joined a jazz band in high school as a bass player. I've been playing with them eversince, 
          and we began playing every month at a family bar close to City College of San Francisco called 
          the Ocean Alehouse where I play with high school students from my high school and my high school music teacher
          Karen Segal as our piano player.

          The main reason why I began pursuing programming in the first place. After I played super mario world for the first time when I was 6
          I was interested in learning more about how tehcnology worked, mainly programs. Fast fowarding to today, I continue playing games
          in my free time. Through Dev/Mission I hope to receive a job in an entry level position with a video game software development team.

          ペラペラ日本語を話せないのにがんばってしている。いろいろな漢字を覚えないので毎日漢字を書かなくてはいけない。
          文法と言葉は書いたり覚えたりしやすいですけど、まだまだ上手じゃない。教室でみんなは「このクラスから忙しくになった」と言っていった。
